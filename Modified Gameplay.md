# The video game has been modified

Nearly every aspect of Tranquility is modified in some way. If something seems different from Vanilla, it's because it's made to be that way.
Here you will find a list of major changes and additions to the game. This list is non-exhaustive; there may be stuff I missed or left out because I didn't feel it was important enough.

## Main Questline, Daedric Quests, Miscellaneous Quests and DLCs

- [Alternate Perspective](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307) is the alternate start choice of Tranquility. Talk to Matlara (Innkeeper of the Resting Pilgrim, Helgen Inn) and select the Option: "I'd like to stay for a while. (Start Intro (XX gold))". This will enable the Main Quest and rent a Bed in Helgens Inn. The next time you Sleep in Helgens Inn the Introduction will start.
- [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464) modifies the level and quest requirements to begin the DLCs, Daedric questlines, and some miscellaneous quests. These are the new triggers to begin the respective quests:
  - Dawnguard Recruitment: Level 30
  - Hearthfire: Level 20
  - Dragonborn: Starts after Horn of Jurgen Windcaller and Level 50
  - The Cursed Tribe: Level 25
  - The Break of Dawn: Level 45. Must not be a Vampire
  - The Only Cure: Level 40
  - A Night to Remember: Level 30
  - Discerning the Transmundane: Level 60
  - The Whispering Door: Level 40
  - Pieces of The Past: Level 35
  - Boethiah's Calling: Level 40
  - The Wolf Queen Awakened: Level 47
  - Unfathomable Depths: Level 32
  - Grimsever's Return: Level 32
  - Deathbrand: Level 36
  - Ebony Warrior: Level 75

## Modified and Expanded Quests

- [Andrealphus' Harder Quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27939?) makes a few of the vanilla quests and requirements harder by increasing the requirement or changing the conditions. The quests that are affected in Tranquility are the Temple of Mara and Bloodkin Questlines.
- [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) adds a large number of localised quests through Missive Boards which you can find in cities.
- [Radiant Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427?) modifies the level requirements for each type of radiant quest. You will no longer be asked to clear out a vampire den or a giant's camp at level 1. These will only be assigned at higher levels.
- [Save The Icerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34681) adds a few alternative paths to the Lights out quest, giving you more options such as reporting Jaree-Ra.
- [The Choice is Yours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3850?) prevents certain quests from starting just from hearing rumours or passing comments. You will no longer get a quest to investigate Aventus's house when hearing guards talk about it for example. Please read the Article tab on the mod page for more information.
- [Thieves Guild Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) overhauls the Thieves Guild questline by adding skill requirements as well as job number requirements to prevent you from completing the questline too early. This combined with [Thieves Night on the Town](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42069), a mod that lets you pick which hold you would like to do radiant quests in, will prevent the Thieves Guild questline from becoming a monotonous grind.

## New Quests and World Encounters

- [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565) is a new worldspace accessible after returning the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller to the Greybeards. It includes a DLC-sized questline that involves travelling to Wyrmstooth on a bounty hunt to slay a dragon.

## Gameplay Overhauls

- Tranquility uses the full suite of [Simon Magus's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files) mods to enhance all the core gameplay aspects of Skyrim. The list of mods included are

  - [Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) which adds religion and prayer as a gameplay aspect tied to the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.

- [Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28608) aims to correct inconsistencies while overhauling the crafting system in Skyrim, allowing for item breakdowns as well as obtaining and understanding how to craft gear such as Falmer and Forsworn.
- [Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim's food and alchemy system aimed to provide a consistent experience from harvesting ingredients to high end potion creation.
- [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) changes the way the game grants you experience. In the base game, your character will level up when you level your skills enough. Through Experience, skill level is decoupled from player level. You now gain experience from discovering locations, completing quests and dungeons as well as killing enemies. Experience also adds skill caps based on player level. No longer will you be able to cheese Smithing up to level 100 just by sitting at a forge for a few hours crafting iron daggers.
- [Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) is a needs and hypothermia mod that requires you to eat, sleep, and drink. This mod is disabled by default in Tranquility. If you wish to play with it just enable it in the MCM.

## Combat and Enemy Tweaks

- [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) overhauls dragons to make encountering them more dangerous and fun.
- [Mortal Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4881) limits your own and your enemies' attack range by limiting the turning radius while attacking. You will now be commmited to your attacks and will no longer be able to swing and spin 360 degrees wildly. Plan your attacks and win.

## Cities & Towns Overhaul

- [JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289?) and all of its interiors overhaul the major and minor cities and towns.
