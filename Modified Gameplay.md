# The video game has been modified

Nearly every aspect of Tranquility is modified in some way. If something seems different from Vanilla, it's because it's made to be that way.
Here you will find a list of major changes and additions to the game. This list is non-exhaustive; there may be stuff I missed or left out because I didn't feel it was important enough.

## Legacy of the Dragonborn

- [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) adds a new museum to the city of Solitude. Tranquility was built around Legacy of the Dragonborn and fully expects you to engage with it. This mod lets you display your accomplishments by showing off weapons, armours, dragon masks, Daedric artifacts, and more that you've obtained on your travels. It also contains a fully-featured player home equipped with a Craftloot system that lets you store and retrieve ingredients from containers for crafting.

## Modified and Expanded Quests

- [Andrealphus' Harder Quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27939?) makes a few of the vanilla quests and requirements harder by increasing the requirement or changing the conditions. The quests that are affected in Tranquility are the Temple of Mara and Bloodkin Questlines.
- [Enhanced Skyrim Factions - The Companions Guild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22650) overhauls the Companions Questline by adding level and skill requirements for progressing through the ranks. It also adds new, unvoiced dialogue as well as AI behaviour changes such as questgivers waiting for you outside of Jorrvaskr for your return.
- [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) adds a large number of localised quests through Missive Boards which you can find in cities.
- [Radiant Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427?) modifies the level requirements for each type of radiant quest. You will no longer be asked to clear out a vampire den or a giant's camp at level 1. These will only be assigned at higher levels.
- [Save The Icerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34681) adds a few alternative paths to the Lights out quest, giving you more options such as reporting Jaree-Ra.
- [Teldryn Serious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5541) is a new backstory mod for Teldryn Sero's dangerous past. Investigate, explore, and fight to uncover his past.
- [The Choice is Yours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3850?) prevents certain quests from starting just from hearing rumours or passing comments. You will no longer get a quest to investigate Aventus's house when hearing guards talk about it for example. Please read the Article tab on the mod page for more information.
- [Thieves Guild Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) overhauls the Thieves Guild questline by adding skill requirements as well as job number requirements to prevent you from completing the questline too early. This combined with [Thieves Night on the Town](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42069), a mod that lets you pick which hold you would like to do radiant quests in, will prevent the Thieves Guild questline from becoming a monotonous grind.

## New Quests and World Encounters

- [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179) adds a new questline in a town that is non-linear and fully open-ended. It is built around the Dwarves' Law that holds a city together by threatening to kill anyone who commits crimes. Someone in that town broke the law and it's your responsibility to find out who.
- [Undeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180) adds a new quest around a powerful necromancer who seeks the forbidden secrets of immortality that could threaten Skyrim. Will you defeat him and stop his plans, or complete what he ultimately could not?
- [Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849) is a dark Vigilants of Stendarr questline that involves hunting Daedra. The quest is very large in scope and has a moral system that influences which ending you will obtain.
- [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565) is a new worldspace accessible after returning the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller to the Greybeards. It includes a DLC-sized questline that involves travelling to Wyrmstooth on a bounty hunt to slay a dragon.

## New NPCs and Followers

- [Auri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278) is a fully voiced Bosmer follower with over 800 lines of custom dialogue. You can find her in her home somewhere in Falkreath Hold. She has custom scenes with some vanilla Bosmer NPCs as well as compatible dialogue with other custom followers.
- [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164) is a custom Corgi follower that you can buy at the Solitude Docks. It has unique functionality like looting from the environment as well as the ability to play fetch!
- [Inconsequential NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36334) adds new NPCs and scenes to Skyrim to enhance the ambiance. These NPCs are, as the name says, inconsequential. They are meant to blend in the background but they are unique and fully voiced and are intended to fill the gaps in various social environments of Skyrim.
- [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461) is a fully voiced Khajiit adventuring companion with over 7000 lines of unique dialogue - much of it about you. He'll level alongside you and avoid most traps. If you're sneaking he won't chatter and he'll whisper if you talk to him. He can run out of arrows. He's highly skilled in Archery, One-Handed, and Sneak.
- [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.
- [Shirley](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45956) is a Skyrim remake of our beloved [Skyrim Grandma](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkY7wa8Ksxv4M5NyUYgTmA) as a follower. She'll join you on your adventures, but don't expect her to carry your burdens.

## Gameplay Overhauls

- Tranquility uses the full suite of [Enai Siaion's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191?tab=user+files) mods to enhance all the core gameplay aspects of Skyrim. The list of mods included are

  - [Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) which adds religion and worship as a gameplay aspect.

- [OMEGA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33718) is a huge overhaul of the game's loot distribution, equipment, and encounter zones that aims to give the game an old school RPG feel. It prevents Glass+ gear from dropping as random loot and adds hand-placed loot to various areas that reward exploration.
- [Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487) is used to overwrite OMEGA's encounter zone changes by bringing things more in line. In general, these will be the levels of various caves and dungeons:
  - Level 05: Bandits
  - Level 10: Draugr, Animals, Spriggans
  - Level 15: Mages, Forsworn
  - Level 20: Falmer, Dwarves
  - Level 25: Vampires, Giants, Dragon Lairs
  - Level 30: Dragon Priest Dungeons, Daedra
- [Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28608) aims to correct inconsistencies while overhauling the crafting system in Skyrim, allowing for item breakdowns as well as obtaining and understanding how to craft gear such as Falmer and Forsworn.
- [Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim's food and alchemy system aimed to provide a consistent experience from harvesting ingredients to high end potion creation.
- [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) changes the way the game grants you experience. In the base game, your character will level up when you level your skills enough. Through Experience, skill level is decoupled from player level. You now gain experience from discovering locations, completing quests and dungeons as well as killing enemies. Experience also adds skill caps based on player level. No longer will you be able to cheese Smithing up to level 100 just by sitting at a forge for a few hours crafting iron daggers.
- [Git Gud - Trainers Have Standards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51023) introduces minimum skill level requirements before expert and master level trainers will provide training to you.
- [Honed Metal Updated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51254) allows blacksmiths and mages all over Skyrim to craft, temper and enchant your equipment for a fee.
- [Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7900) is a full overhaul to hunting and looting animals and monsters. No longer will you be able to obtain pristine pelts from killing wolves and sabre cats. Instead, you will need a hunting knife to skin the animal, butcher its meat, and harvest ingredients from it.
- [Lock Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14927) overhauls the lockpicking system in Skyrim. You now need to invest into your Lockpicking tree to be able to pick locks, or you can smash locks or unlock them via magic if you're specialised enough in those skill trees.
- [Spellforge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46482) adds a new, engaging method of spell acquisition through spell crafting. You can place a spellforge in any location and begin spellcrafting, and with enough effort you will obtain new spells. In order to incentivise the use of this mechanic all Adept+ spellbooks have been removed from the wild and all spellbooks sold by vendors have their prices tripled.
- [Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) is a needs and hypothermia mod that requires you to eat, sleep, and drink. This mod is disabled by default in Tranquility. If you wish to play with it just enable it in the MCM.

## Combat and Enemy Tweaks

- [Briraka's Draugr Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26188), [Cannibal Draugr on Solstheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21238) and [Draugr Upgrades and Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21775) overhaul Draugr by giving them new skills, new variations as well as new bosses to fight. These Draugr ensure your time spent in dungeons will be filled with joy and frustration. ;)
- [Deadly Dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23723), [Diverse Dragon Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/695) and [Splendor - Dragon Variants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9670) overhaul dragons by making them more difficult as well as adding a lot more variety to the types of dragons that will spawn.

- [Know Your Enemy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13807) adds a trait system to change resistances and weaknesses of creatures and armours to magic, pysical attacks, arrows, and diseases.
- [Mortal Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4881) limits your own and your enemies' attack range by limiting the turning radius while attacking. You will now be commmited to your attacks and will no longer be able to swing and spin 360 degrees wildly. Plan your attacks and win.
- [Ordinator for Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42022) distributes perks from Ordinator to various npcs and encounters making higher level combat harder as the enemies now have access to the same perks as you do.
- [SkyTEST - Realistic Animals and Predators](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1104) is an AI and difficulty tweak to animals in Skyrim. Wolves will now be smarter and try to kite the player while being afraid of fire.
- [Skyrim Revamped - Complete Enemy Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14598) is a combat difficulty mod that changes enemy AI, spell preference, and attack diversity. Enemies will be much more aggressive than vanilla and will have abilities to show for it.
- [Skyrim Revamped - Rebalanced and Releveled](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27201) is a tweak to Skyrim Revamped which modifies boss encounters to scale with the player's level instead of being a static level. This ensures the fights are still challenging and will scale as you get stronger.
- [Ultimate Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45966) overhauls humanoid, centurion, giant, and dragon priest AI, and provides new attacks. Enemies will be able to dodge your attacks.
