# The video game has been modified

Nearly every aspect of Tranquillity is modified in some way. If something seems different from Vanilla, it's because its made to be that way.
Here you will find a list of major changes and additions to the game. This list is non-exhaustive, there may be stuff I missed out or left out because I didn't feel it was important enough.

## Legacy of the Dragonborn

- [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) adds a new museum to the city of Solitude. Tranquillity was built around Legacy of the Dragonborn and fully expects you to be engaging with it. This mod lets you display your accomplishments throughout your gameplay by showing off weapons, armours, dragon masks, daedric artifacts and more that you've obtained throughout your travels. It also contains a fully featured house equipped with a Craftloot system that lets you store and retrieve ingredients from containers for crafting

## Modified and Expanded Quests

- [Thieves Guild Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) overhaulsl the Thieves Guild questline by adding skill requirements as well as job number requirements to prevent you from completing the questline too early. This combined with [Thieves Night on the Town](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42069), a mod that lets you pick which hold you would like to do radiant quests with will prevent the thieves guild from being a monotonous grind
